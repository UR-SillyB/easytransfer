/**
 * Filename helpers shared by the receive / detail / bundle activities.
 *
 * Historically each activity had its own copy of a "sanitize" regex that
 * aggressively stripped everything except ASCII alphanumerics and the CJK
 * Unified Ideographs basic block (U+4E00..U+9FFF). That mangled real-world
 * names — spaces, full-width punctuation (（）), CJK extension characters and
 * most symbols were all replaced with `_`, so a name like `报告 2024.docx`
 * became `报告_2024.docx` and Chinese filenames frequently failed to carry
 * through to share targets (WeChat / QQ / mail clients derive the display
 * name from the FileProvider URI, which used the mangled disk name).
 *
 * Android filesystems (and the SAF) accept a wide range of characters; only
 * a handful are genuinely illegal across filesystems. These helpers strip
 * *only* those, preserving spaces and all CJK characters.
 *
 * The recovered filename is attacker-controllable (decoded from a scanned QR),
 * so [sanitize] also defends against path traversal: it keeps only the final
 * path component, strips separators and control characters, and removes leading
 * dots so the result can never be `.`/`..`/a hidden traversal name. Call sites
 * that write into a directory should use [uniqueTarget], which additionally
 * verifies the resolved path stays inside that directory.
