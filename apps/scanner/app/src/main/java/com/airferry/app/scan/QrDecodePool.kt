/**
 * Decouples camera capture from QR decoding.
 *
 * The CameraX analyzer (the *producer*) copies each frame's Y (luminance) plane
 * into a pooled buffer, enqueues it, and immediately closes the `ImageProxy`. A
 * pool of N worker threads drains the queue and runs ZXing on each frame (on a
 * center ROI first, see [decode]). Every decoded payload is handed to
 * [onDecoded] under a single [ingestLock], so the **non-thread-safe** native
 * receiver (the `transfer_engine` JNI handle) is only ever touched by one thread
 * at a time — ZXing decode runs fully parallel, native ingest stays serialized.
 *
 * Out-of-order delivery is fine: RaptorQ symbols are keyed by `(sbn, esi)`, so
 * dropping or reordering frames never corrupts recovery — it only costs time.
 *
 * @param onDecoded invoked (serialized) with each decoded QR payload.

     *     crop a small window (the bbox expanded by [TRACK_MARGIN]) and decode
     *     it. On a screen QR the code barely moves frame-to-frame, so this
     *     window is far smaller than the fixed center region — much less ZXing
     *     work, raising the sustainable decode rate.
     *  2. **Center ROI**: the fixed large center region (the QR is nominally
     *     centered). Used on a tracked miss, or before the first lock.
     *  3. **Full frame**: only 1 in [FULL_DECODE_EVERY] consecutive ROI misses,
     *     to catch an off-center/oversized browser QR without paying for a full
     *     decode every frame. A full-frame hit also seeds [lastQrBbox].
     *
     * Both ROI tiers use the zero-copy native crop and report the QR's bbox, so
     * any successful decode refreshes [lastQrBbox] for the next frame's tier-1.
