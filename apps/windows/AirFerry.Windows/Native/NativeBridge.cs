/// <b>Symbol names</b>: Rust exports snake_case <c>airferry_*</c> symbols (the
/// C ABI contract in <c>cffi.rs</c>). Unlike Android's JNI — where the JVM
/// resolves <c>Java_&lt;class&gt;_&lt;method&gt;</c> names automatically — the
/// .NET P/Invoke marshaler looks up the entry point by the managed method name
/// unless <see cref="DllImportAttribute.EntryPoint"/> is given. Every declaration
/// below therefore pins <c>EntryPoint</c> explicitly: dropping it would make the
/// first call throw <c>EntryPointNotFoundException</c> at runtime (the build and
/// the protocol-layer unit tests never touch native code, so they can't catch it).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Thread safety</b>: the Rust <c>ReceiverSession</c> is <b>not</b>
/// thread-safe. All calls touching the same handle must be serialized by the
/// caller — the Windows scan pool mirrors Android's <c>ingestLock</c> (a single
/// fair lock wrapping batched ingest + assemble).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Memory ownership</b>: <see cref="ReceiverAssemble"/> returns a buffer
/// allocated by Rust; the host MUST copy the bytes out and then call
/// <see cref="BufferFree"/>. The <c>*_IntoBuffer</c> functions write into a
/// host-owned buffer using a two-pass length protocol (pass a 0-capacity buffer
/// first to learn the required length, then re-call with a buffer of that
