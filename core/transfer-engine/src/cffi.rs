//! C ABI bindings for the receiver side (Windows / .NET P/Invoke).
//!
//! Mirrors [`jni`] (Android) but exposes a plain C ABI so any C-compatible
//! host — C# P/Invoke, C/C++, Python ctypes — can drive a receive session
//! without the JVM. Used by the AirFerry Windows client
//! (`apps/windows/AirFerry.Windows`).
//!
//! ## Handle model
//! A receiver session is heap-allocated (`Box<ReceiverSession>`), and its raw
//! pointer is returned to the caller as an opaque `*mut`. Every function takes
//! that handle back as its first argument; pass null to release it via
//! [`airferry_receiver_destroy`]. The pointer is *not* thread-safe — the host
//! must serialize all calls that touch the same handle (the Windows client
//! does this with a single ingest lock, exactly like Android's `ingestLock`).
//!
//! ## Memory ownership
//! - Strings/byte buffers returned by value (e.g. [`airferry_receiver_ingest`]'s
//!   status word) are copied and need no cleanup.
//! - [`airferry_receiver_assemble`] returns a Rust-allocated buffer + length;
//!   the caller must copy the bytes out and then call [`airferry_buffer_free`]
//!   on the pointer to release Rust's allocation. Never `free` it from the host.
//! - `*_into_buffer` functions (progress JSON, file name) take a caller-owned
//!   buffer + capacity and return the number of bytes written (or, when the
//!   buffer is null/too small, the required length so the caller can
//!   re-allocate and retry). No Rust-side allocation crosses the boundary.
